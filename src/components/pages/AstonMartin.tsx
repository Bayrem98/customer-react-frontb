            *How not to know this British brand widely put in before in James
            Bond films. In 1913, pilot Lionel Martin made a car to participate
            in the Aston race Clinton, of which he was the winner in 1914. The
            merger of the two names gave “Aston Martin”. The logo comes when it
            comes from the Egyptian god Khepri, symbolized by a beetle. Aston
            Martin represents the mix perfect between elegant and fast car. It's
            up to you to choose your preferred between the Aston Martin Vantage,
            the Rapide or the DB11, descendant of the DB5 which was the first
            model to appear in James Bond Goldfinger in 1964. Simple precision,
            your Aston Martin unfortunately won't fire missiles at bad guys.
