            *It was in 1904 that Rolls-Royce began to build its first cars. It
            was following the death of Charles Rolls in 1910 that the first of
            the two Rs in the "RR" logo changes from red to black. the second
            will do the same on the death of the second founder, Frederick
            Royce. It was in 1914 that the company converted to the manufacture
            of aircraft engines, particularly during the first and second World
            War. Nationalized in 1971, Rolls-Royce will eventually divide into
            two entities, the automotive division under the name of Rolls-Royce
            Motors and the aerospace division, Rolls-Royce plc. Today,
            Rolls-Royce Motor Cars is owned by the German manufacturer BMW and
            is renowned for producing the best and most luxurious cars in the
            world. It's in 2016 that the Rolls Royce Cullinan was launched for a
            price of 344,000 euros, by becoming the most expensive SUV in the
            world, well ahead of the Bentley Bentyaga (217,800 euros). You can
            also invest in a Rolls Royce Silver Cloud III, a collector's item
            for a few â‚¬200,000 !
